        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>As a rental company, JeepsKauai believes that we can offer a more unique jeep rental experience than the competitor. We aim to customize the jeep rental business for those who want to experience Kauai. With our local knowledge of the island and ability to direct customers to great hikes, beaches, outings and views. We also want them to not waste any of their precious vacation time going around renting other equipment, or not knowing where to visit while here on island. 
            We believe that those with greater knowledge and experience about the Island can share this knowledge with others to improve their capabilities to enjoy the island safely. Allowing a greater number of people to experience and enjoy the Island and the beauty it holds. Our website will provide the ability to rent, both jeeps and adventure equipment and provide a way to leave reviews from experiences with us.
            </p> <!-- change this -->


        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>Our ideal customer is a Kauai tourist who would like to arrive to Kauai and be ready for adventure the moment they step into the rented Jeep. This is ideal for two reasons: One it does not waste any of the renter’s time, searching around for equipment or a capable vehicle. Many tourists’ customers arrive on the island with an idea of the things they would like to do while here on island, such as but not limited to, hiking, snorkeling, Stand up paddle boarding, kayaking, beach days, boogie boarding, surfing, etc. </p> <!-- change this -->
